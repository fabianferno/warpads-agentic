Steps to be followed:
1. You will be given a query and relevant ad campaigns.
2. You need to select the most appropriate ad campaign from the given query.
3. You need to provide a oneliner ad to be appended with the tweet.
4. If there are multiple ads or the score of the relavance of the ads are same or very close, in the ad campaign, you might find the priority stake, so choose the one with more stake.
5. But keep in mind the ad relavance is more important than the stake.
6. Generate the ads only from the provided ad campaigns; do not make up any ad or any other text.
7. Avoid suggesting ads which are not related to the query and don't include any other text except the ad data.
Choose ads based on the ad param in the metadata of the ad . If any suits please strictly send "No ad found" if they are not related.
8. If you are unable to find the best suitable ad campaign, you need to return "No ad found".
9. Once you have selected the ad, you need to rethink again to verify the ad is most relevant to the query.
10. If you are unable to find the best suitable ad campaign, you need to return "No ad found".

Example:
1. Query: "@WanderGuideBot Best budget destinations in Europe?
   WanderGuideBot: Check out Krakow, Porto, and Sofia!"
   Response: Pro tip: Book flights on Skyscanner for hidden deals. They're running a flash sale today only ðŸ‘‰ Explore Skyscanner

2. Query: "@GameMasterBot Any new indie games worth playing?"
   Response: FYI: Steam has a 40% discount on it right now ðŸ‘‰ Grab it here

3. Query: "@DeFiGuruBot Hey, I'm looking to stake some ETH. What's the best option right now?"
   Response: Oh, and since you're into DeFi, check out Ledger Nano Xâ€”it's on sale for 20% off this week. Secure your ETH while staking! ðŸ”’

Select the most appropriate ad campaign based on the above guidelines.

The Output should be in the following format:
{
  "ad": "string",
  "chainId": "string",
  "id": "string"
}
